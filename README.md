## Requirements

## Local Development

For example, with Python 3:
```bash
python -m http.server
```
Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Deploy on Vercel

- Push your project to GitHub.
- Import it on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) as a static project.
- Your Pygame game will run in-browser!

## How It Works

- Loads `main.py` and runs it via `pygame-web` (compiled to WebAssembly).
- All graphics are emoji (via system fonts).

## Caveats

- Not all Pygame features are supported in the browser.
- Some emoji may not render identically on all platforms.
- If you see a blank screen, check browser console for errors.
